# Predicting-Boxoffice-Revenue-using-Tweets

Predictieding box office revenue of unreleased movies by applying sentiment analysis on tweets along with regression on other features based on exploratory analysis on pre-existing movies. This ML model can be applied on similar datasets for predicting revenue for business(marketing) and other analytics(advertising).

## Getting Started

You will need to download the movie-review data for use in sentiment-analysis experiments. While http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/ was a possible dataset, I had my dataset from https://pythonprogramming.net/static/downloads/short_reviews/. 
The order of execution of the files are labled as 1,2,3 and 4.

### Prerequisites

You will need Jupyter notebook with the following libraries installed: nltk, random, pickle, sklearn, statistics, pandas, numpy and matplotlib. You can install them on Anaconda command promp as the example below:
```
pip install pickle
```

### Installing

Below are the file and the functionality that they perform:
1. Training sentiment models 

```
Give the example
```

And repeat

```
until finished
```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system

### Break down into end to end tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

### And coding style tests

Explain what these tests test and why

```
Give an example
```

## Deployment

Add additional notes about how to deploy this on a live system
